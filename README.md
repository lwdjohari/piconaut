# Piconaut Microframework
Lightweight modern REST/Web micro-framework for C++ 14 &amp; 17.

For full fledged Modern Server Framework, please find [NvServ](https://github.com/lwdjohari/nvserv).

> [!WARNING]
> Currently compatibility with C++14 is not yet throughly tested.<br/>
> Status : WIP, Experimental & Unstable.  

# Development & Dependencies

Piconaut use h2o proven http1.1/http2 webserver as the underlying http server.

## Development
- CMake 3.10
- C++14/C++17 compiler

## Shared Dependencies
- Lib H2O Http Server (evloop) >= v2.5
- OpenSSL >= v1.1
- Lib UV (use for capture cross platform signal)
- Lib Wslay
- Zlib

Note: Debian or Ubuntu linux based
```shell
sudo apt-get update && \
sudo apt-get install \
    libh2o-evloop-dev \
    openssl \
    libssl-dev \
    libuv1-dev \
    libwslay-dev \
    zlib1g-dev
```

### Checking your shared-lib
In linux you can check for already installed shared library by executing this command
```shell
dpkg-query -l | grep libuv-dev
dpkg-query -l | grep libwslay-dev
```
Find your dependencies location
```shell
dpkg -L libwslay-dev
```

### Troubleshooting

Somehow in ubuntu, libwslay can't be found by original cmake find_package.<br/>
Piconaut work around is adding custom FindWslay.cmake module in ```cmake``` folder

```cmake
find_package(Wslay REQUIRED)
if(NOT WSLAY_FOUND)
    message(FATAL_ERROR "wslay library not found")
endif()
```

This will ensure CMake configuration for H2o found libwslay.so correctly.
